Abstract:

Servbot Dash is an endless runner, or infinite runner, built using Unreal Engine 4 (UE4 or “the engine”) and targeting the mobile platforms Android and iOS. In Servbot Dash, the player will maneuver the endlessly running character through the procedurally generated course, trying to gather as many gems as possible in order to get the highest score, while avoiding the obstacles and course walls for as long as possible.
